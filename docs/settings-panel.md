# Settings panel — Ka0s Drop Watcher

Built on LibKa0s-Options from the descriptor in `settings/OptionsSetup.lua`. The category registers
eagerly at `OnEnable`; each page's body builds on its first show (options-ui-§1/§5).

| Page | Covers |
|---|---|
| Ka0s Drop Watcher (landing) | The logo, the TOC notes line and the slash command list, drawn by the library's `BuildLandingPage` |
| General | `Master controls`, `When to show` |
| Profiles | AceDBOptions: switch, copy, reset and delete profiles |

## General → Master controls

Composed by `Helpers.MasterControls` from one declaration (`settings/Panel.lua`), canonical rows in
canonical order (options-ui-§15):

| Left | Right |
|---|---|
| Enable Ka0s Drop Watcher (`enabled`) | General visibility (`visibility`) |
| Master scale (`scale`) | Master alpha (`alpha`) |
| Lock frame (`locked`) | Debug console (`state.debugConsole`, session) |
| Minimap button (`global.minimap.shown`) | Test mode (`state.testMode`, session) |
| Reset position (button) | Reset all settings (button, asks first) |

Every row writes through the one seam (`NS.SchemaRuntime.Set`), and its reaction is the same one
the CLI, the launcher and the host verbs trigger (`Settings.REACTIONS` in `settings/Schema.lua`).
The header's Defaults button and Reset all settings both open the confirmation popup; the global
reset is a profile reset and never touches the minimap button (options-ui-§12, launcher-§3).

## General → When to show

The master `autoOpen` row, then each situation's `Track`, `Auto-open` and `Quality` rows under the
situation's name (design spec §6.1). Until the settings pages land (DW-41) they draw as one block
per situation rather than as a grid.

## Still to come

The design's other pages (spec §12.2): Feed, Comparison, Trade, Messages and Window. Their rows
exist already (`settings/SchemaRows.lua`, each with its `page` and its tab as `group`), so
`/dw list|get|set|reset` reach them today; DW-41 registers the pages that draw them.
